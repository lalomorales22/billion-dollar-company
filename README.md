# 3. Start Celery worker (in another terminal)
./run_worker.sh

# 4. Start Flask application
python app.py
```

## Using Local AI with Ollama

1. Ensure Ollama is running:
```bash
# Check if Ollama is running
curl -f http://localhost:11434/api/tags || echo "Ollama not running"

# Start Ollama if needed
ollama serve
```

2. Verify the model is available:
```bash
ollama list
# Should show gpt-oss:20b in the list
```

3. Test an agent:
- Go to Agents page
- Click on any agent
- Use the "Test Agent" section
- Enter a prompt and click "Run Test"
- Wait for local model processing (may take longer than cloud APIs)

4. Process a project:
- Create a new project
- Click "Advance to Stage 2"
- All agents will execute using local Ollama model
- Watch real-time notifications appear

## Architecture Improvements

### AI Provider Module (`ai_providers.py`)
- Unified interface for Ollama local AI
- Zero cost calculation (local model)
- Error handling and timeout management
- Token usage estimation

### Background Tasks (`celery_tasks.py`)
- `execute_agent_async` - Run agents in background

### ðŸš¨ Troubleshooting Common Issues

**"Unable to connect to Ollama" error:**
- Check if Ollama is running: `curl http://localhost:11434/api/tags`
- Start Ollama service: `ollama serve`
- Verify the gpt-oss:20b model is installed: `ollama list`

**Tasks stuck in "processing":**
- Check if Celery worker is running: `ps aux | grep celery`
- Restart worker: `./run_worker.sh`
- Check Redis is running: `redis-cli ping`

**No real-time notifications:**
- Refresh the page to reconnect WebSocket
- Check browser console for errors
- Ensure you're using a modern browser

**Slow AI responses:**
- Local models take longer than cloud APIs (1-3 minutes normal)
- Ensure adequate RAM (gpt-oss:20b requires significant memory)
- Consider using a smaller model if response time is critical
- Monitor system resources during processing

### ðŸŽŠ Congratulations!

You now have your own AI-powered business automation system. Each project you create is a step toward building a billion-dollar company with zero employees. The AI agents are your workforce, the pipeline is your process, and the only limit is your imagination.
